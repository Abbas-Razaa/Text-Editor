In this chapter, we introduce Classes and how these can be used together
with . Over the course of the chapter you will explore both declaration
and extension of objects. These techniques are important and will provide a
good reference as your Dart skills increase over time.
The chapter covers how to incorporate a Class which represents a basic
requirement for object oriented programming. In addition we also cover the
need for constructors, extending classes and using multiple classes together.
As your development becomes more sophisticated, you will be able to
utilize custom classes to achieve your requirements. Becoming efficient
with Classes is a steep learning curve, so take small steps. Overtime, you
will naturally improve and be able to incorporate very complex subject
matter into your general solutions.
